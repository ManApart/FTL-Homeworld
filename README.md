FTL-Homeworld
=============

FTL program for save editing in a non cheating way

Building off my first Java program, FTL Homeworld includes the following programs:

Spacedock allows players to manage multiple ships, so that they can play different ships at the same time. Dock a ship to store it and then start a new game or board another ship. Then use boarding/docking to switch between ships at any time.

Cargo Bay (WIP) allows players to store items from their ships in the cargo bay, and then trade them to other ships in their 'fleet'.


//Credit to by Vhati and ComaToes for their FTLEditor and allowing me to use their source //FTL Editor found here: http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=10959&start=70 //I've modeled this class after SavedGameState (from FTL Editor), as well as copied and then modified chunks of its code. //Anything that reads or writes savegame data was either inspired by, copied from, or depends on FTL Editor //I'm especially indebted to Vhati who gave me permission to use the code as well as answered my questions as I worked through my first java program.

Also, credit to Lologarithm for patching up a lot of holes in FTL Spacedock; I'm working on encorperating his changes here. Thank you!
